# Problem Statement Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two
# baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket
# can have only one type of fruit. You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. You
# will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit
# type. Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
# Example 1: Input: Fruit=['A', # 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
# Output: 3 Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the
# subarray ['C', 'A', 'C'] Example 2: Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C'] Output: 5 Explanation: We can put 3
# 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket. This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C',
# 'B', 'B', 'C']
